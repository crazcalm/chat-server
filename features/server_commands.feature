Feature: Server Commands
    I want to list out the different commands that
    I want the server to respond to.

    list:
        /disconnent
        /whoami
        /whois [name]
        /msg [name]
        /help [command]
        /people
        /chatroom
        /set [property] [value]

    properties list:
        - name
        - description

    Background: I am connected to the chat server
        Given I came connected to the chat server as person1

    Scenario: Disconnecting from the chat
        When the client sends "/disconnect"
        Then the client should receive "disconnected"
        And the client socket should be disconnected

    Scenario Outline: Commands that do not involve other clients
        When the client sends <command>
        Then the client should receive <response>
        
    Examples: Commands and responses
        | command               | response               |
        | "/whoami"             | "person1"              |
        | "/help"               | "The list of commands" |
        | "/help whoami"        | "/whoami"  |
        | "/help whois"         | "/whois" |
        | "/help disconnect"    | "/disconnect"  |
        | "/help msg"           | "/msg [name]"    |
        | "/help help"          | "help [command]"              |
        | "/help people"        | "/people"      |
        | "/help chatroom"      | "/chatroom"     |
        | "/help set"           | "/set [property] [value]"  |
        | "/people"             | "person1"                           |

    Scenario Outline: Commands that involve other clients
        Given person2 is in the chatroom
        When the client sends <command>
        Then the client should receive <response>

    Examples: Commands with proper arguements
        | command                   | response              |
        | "/whois person2"          | "person2's ip is"     | 
        | "/msg person2"            | "I got you msg!"      |
        | "/people"                 | "person2"             |
        | "/set name marcus"        | "name: marcus"        |
        | "/set description I am me"| "description: I am me"|

    Examples: Commands with wrong arguements
        | command        | response                       |
        | "/who unknown" | "That person does not exist..."| 
        | "/msg unknown" | "That person does not exist..."|
